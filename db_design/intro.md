What is Database ?

	• Stores data
	• Data can be anything, it is board 

How it is different from spreadsheet?

	• We can run complex queries with database
	• We create different users in database like admin and normal users etc,(Security feature)
We cannot do above things with spread sheet

Relational 

	• Connection between data like relation b/w numbers in set math concept.
	• In math, we connect (group) 2 numbers, here we connect 2 objects.
	
	
	
	• Entity -> anything we store about
	• Attribute -> what we are going to store
		○ Entity - Person
		○ Atrribute - name, age, gender etc.
	
		
		
		• Table - graphical way to illustrate   how we storing data in database
			
		
			
			
			
			Caleb is Entity and name, username, password is attrbute, now we are connecting both using relation(table)
			
			We enter specfic values for each one of these attributes to make relation b/w attribute and entity i.e table (relation)
			
			• Row - all attribute values for a specfic entity
			• Column - all values for specfic attribute
	
	• Entity Type - User (category of entity we are storing i. each person is an entity)
	• Attribute Type - each attribute

			
RDBMS

	• Management system allows to manage the data, view etc in database
	• View mecahnism -> change surface and apperence of the data
		• We can get different views of data 
		• Selecting specfic columns in select queries -> view mechanism allows this
		• There is another concept of view also
	• Allows us to do transaction i.e does completely or revert all operation done
		• Acid property
	• Eg. MySQl,Oracle, MS SQL
	• Take data from harddriver and put data in form tables for relation tables
